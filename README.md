# Statistics_BERofNoisyTransmissionSignal
The goal of this MATLAB project was to simulate the bit error rate of a noisy transmission signal. A correctly transmitted signal will have a value of 0 at ‘-v’ signal level, and a value of 1 at ‘v’ signal level. Added with the noise ‘w’, the total signal value ‘s’ can be determined as s = v + w. For a value of 1, S>0. Otherwise, the value will be 0. In this assignment, I calculate the bit error rate that the transmission will have detected error bits S that differ from the original signal V, which is the probability P(S&lt;0). Results are shown graphically and numerically for 100,000 bits of data.
